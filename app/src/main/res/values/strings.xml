    <string name="info">According to PhiVolcs (Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology), the Valley Fault System showed that the big quake will pass through the dense Metro Manila area and can shake the neighboring provinces. PhiVolcs also said that NCR will face isolation from nearby provinces because of collapsed roads and buildings. The fault systems from north to south and east to west will get the greatest threat.</string>
    <string name="info2">Collapsed buildings in Makati and Mandaluyong cities may separate northern and southern parts of the Metro, while broken road networks will isolate the west and the east. Just like what happened in 1990 at Baguio.</string>
    <string name="info3">According to Jerry Velasquez of United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, the potential quake is not a prediction over a specified time but for sure, it will happen. No one knows when. According to some reports, it’s even described as ‘long overdue’. The valley fault system moved four times in the last 1,400 years – on the estimate every 400 years and the last time was about 356 years ago in 1658.</string>
